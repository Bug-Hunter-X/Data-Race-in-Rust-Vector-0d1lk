This repository demonstrates a common data race bug in Rust when working with vectors.  The `bug.rs` file contains the buggy code, which attempts to access an element of a vector while another thread is modifying the vector. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and crashes. The `bugSolution.rs` file demonstrates how to fix this bug using appropriate synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes or channels. This example highlights the importance of careful consideration of mutability and concurrency in Rust.
